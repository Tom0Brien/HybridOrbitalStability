# Exponentially Stable Regulation of Mechanical Systems to a Path
This repository contains code to implement path following control for fully-actuated mechanical systems using the technique of total energy shaping. The controller is implemented in `controller.m` for a simple 2-DOF manipulator defined in `model.m`.
 
 ### Instructions
Run `main.m`
